**Introduction** :   We know that recent surge of popularity in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  industry is due to the ease of its problem solving methodology. The  Artificial Narrow Intelligence ,the era we are in, has helped the corporate world to solve real world problems .  Healthcare, Education, Finance are other industries which have attained fruitful outcomes by applying AI/ML techniques in day to day problems.

**Problem Statement**: As the project title suggests, we have to track the performance of students  in real time. Effective teachers do not just deliver quality educational opportunities — they also diligently track student progress to measure results. Tracking progress benefits both students and teachers. Students can see how they’re doing in various subjects, and teachers can see which of their teaching approaches are working and where they might need to make adjustments.

**Tools and Installations**:
Software: VS Code, Jupyter or Google Colaboratory(Online)
Installations: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Pillow, Sklearn Library ,Seaborn ,Matplotlib Random  Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier,Support Vector Classifier,

**Conclusion**:
This project focuses on working with real time data  so more focus is made on conducting quiz, assignments all online and promote academic tutors and students to get familiar with the same so as to prevent any  discrepancies. The motive is to get insights on academic patterns of students .Thus monitor them  and help them enhance their performance and results. Instructors need to periodically update  the data to achieve best and accurate  results from the model.

 I hope this model is able to solve the  problem statement in practical manner.
